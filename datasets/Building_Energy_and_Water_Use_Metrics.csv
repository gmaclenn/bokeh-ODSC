Regarding the increased usage, we had issues with our chillers from March – May.  We have two roof top chillers and typically only need to run one, but this spring had to run both in order to be able to fulfil cooling needs for the building until the repairs were made.  I think this was probably the cause for the increase.   We also have one tenant on the 4th floor (that moved in January 2014) that has been holding events on the week nights.  Probably 1 night",
