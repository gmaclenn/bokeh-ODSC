According to the Massachusetts Audubon Society  ducks have adapted to this climate and will move to find open water if they need to. Ponds in this region have frozen each winter for millennia and ducks have survived here. Ducks are primarily herbivores and rarely eat fish. We have seen this happen seasonally for many years.  According to Audoban Society  the ducks will be fine.  If you have any questions  please contact us on the Parkline at 617-635-7275.

Private contractors are required to restore the sidewalk to original condition within 60 days of completion of their temporary work.     Because we are in the winter moratorium season of concrete/brick work (November 15-April 15)  the restoration work will be held off until next spring.     The utility company has been notified that the repairs must take place next April.      The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.

Closed date : 2016-08-19 09:01:45.217 Case Resolved National Grid is installing a new main on your street. The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.     The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However in the long run the construction is well worth it.     Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed  the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future.     The CIU inspector states the contractor uses steel plates at the end of each work day so traffic can safely pass by.    The inspector will monitor the worksite to ensure full compliance with the city's rules.     The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.
