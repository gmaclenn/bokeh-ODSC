Utility companies are required to restore the sidewalk to original condition within 60 days of completion of their temporary work.     Because we are in the winter moratorium season of concrete/brick work (November 15-April 15)  the restoration work will be held off until next spring.     The utility company has been notified that the repairs must take place next April.      The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will remind the utility companies next April about their obligation to restore the sidewalks within 2 weeks of the 2014 construction season.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.    Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates.    We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting for upcoming work.    Since this is a patching contract  the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up.    Sometimes poor weather  plant breakdowns  or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.    The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise.    The street will be topped today.    The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

Both N.Star and Sheerin removed the plate with the Sheerin name on it and discovered that this was an abandon work zone. That the work was water related and the plate was stolen from a  Sheerin work zone sometime in the past.    There is no record of a permit pulled at the location  in addition BWSC engineering states nobody submitted an engineering plan.    N.Star secured the plate on Sunday and then as a favor to the city back filled and paved the opening on Monday.    The CIU  will still try to find who did this work.

This is because motorists will need to stop in advance of the crosswalk  which isn't always the 'natural' stopping point at an intersection. If motorists are rolling through the stop sign  they know it is there and painting a stop line will not change that behavior.

On April 20th the inspector states that there is access to the roadway  but the sidewalk in blocked off.    The roadway is in poor condition because it is a private way.    The City can not touch private ways.    Suggest that if the roadway and sidewalks are blocked off and you see no police details you call the Mayors Hotline and request that the  Police Department investigate.
